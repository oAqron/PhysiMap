# PhysiMap
PhysiMap is an AI-assisted physique analysis tool that helps lifters identify over- and under-emphasized muscle groups and adjust training bias to better align with aesthetic goals. The project focuses on explainable logic, structured sports-science reasoning, and responsible LLM integration rather than black-box “AI coaching.”
